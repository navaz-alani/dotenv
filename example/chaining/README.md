# `golangdotenv` Example 

The chaining feature in `golangdotenv` can be beneficial to
when developing applications which have to be run and
tested in multiple environments.

`golangdotenv` makes the seperation of environemnts in a program
very easy. Not just that, but multiple environments can exist at
the same time within the same application.

The program in this directory demonstrates how to use the struct ENV
across multiple files in the project.
